Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of Red Teaming! In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to set up Jekyll with the captivating and dynamic Chirpy theme. With this combination, you'll have a stunning website that's perfect for sharing your Red Teaming adventures and insights.

We'll guide you through the process of configuring your site, creating pages using Markdown, setting up automatic builds with a GitHub action, and best of all, hosting your blog for free on GitHub Pages.

# Prerequisites & Installation

Installing Ruby and other Prerequisites.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```

To ensure a secure and efficient installation of RubyGems packages (commonly referred to as 'gems'), it's advisable to refrain from installing them as the root user. Instead, we recommend establishing a dedicated gem installation directory within your user account. By executing the following commands, you can conveniently configure environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` file to set up this personalized gem installation path.

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, install `Jekyll` and `Bundler`.

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Creating the Website

### Create a GitHub repository

Begin by logging into your GitHub account and proceed to [Chirpy Starter Template](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork) to create a fork of the repository. After forking, rename the repository to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` should be replaced with your GitHub username.

### Clone The Repository & Install Prerequisites

Once you've generated a website using the provided template, proceed to clone your repository.

```bash
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-USER-NAME>.github.io.git
```

Change to the `USERNAME.github.io` directory which we cloned.

```bash
cd USERNAME.github.io
```

Then install dependencies

```bash
bundle
```

### Starting the Local Server

To preview your site contents without the need to frequently push changes to GitHub, use the following command to locally publish the site.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

In just a few moments, the local service will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
